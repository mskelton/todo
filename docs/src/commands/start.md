# start

Start working on a task.

```bash
todo 12 start
```

Tasks that have been started are given increased [urgency](../urgency.md) in the
task list. Additionally, a visual indicator is provided to indicate tasks you
have started working on. These combined help to encourage completing tasks that
have already been started before starting additional tasks.
